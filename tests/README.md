# Setup

If changing the base model latte files, you'll need to recreate them for the tests to take effect.

These can be generated by creating a MySQL database, import the `models_mysql.sql` file and create the base model files.

`./bin/granadabuilder tests/testdb2modelconf.json`

Modify the `testdb2modelconf.json` file temporarily to suit your environment.
